- Displays the total amount of Robux across all groups with funds.
- Opens links for groups with funds in a specified format (`https://www.roblox.com/groups/{groupID}/groupName#!/about`).

## Usage

2. Run the script, which will read the cookies, fetch group information, and check funds.
3. The script will display group details and the total amount of Robux across groups with funds.
4. After displaying the summary, it will open links for groups with funds in your default web browser.
